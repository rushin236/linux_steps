# 🐧 How to do stuff in Linux

Welcome to my personal Linux guide repo! This is a collection of helpful
commands, setups, and tricks that I regularly use on my
[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
system. Instead of searching online every time, I’ve documented all the
essentials here so I can easily copy & paste when needed.

This repo serves as a hands-on guide and documentation for:

- Installing tools and packages.
- Speeding up setup time on new systems.
- Learning more about how Linux works by doing.
